## 🔍 Overview

So_Long is a 2D puzzle game where the player moves through a grid, collects chests, and reaches the exit while avoiding obstacles like walls. The goal is to implement the game with proper memory management and efficient use of C programming concepts like dynamic memory allocation, user input handling, and basic game mechanics.

## 🛠 Features

- **Grid-based Game Map:** A grid of tiles where the player interacts with objects such as walls, floors, and exit.
- **Player Movement:** The player can move around the map using arrow keys or WASD input.
- **Game Progression:** The player needs to collect all chests and reach the exit to complete the level.
- **Obstacle Handling:** The game includes walls obstacles the player must avoid to succeed.
- **Exit Condition:** The game finishes when the player reaches the exit tile with all the chests collected.
- **Memory Management:** Dynamically allocated memory is used to represent the map and game entities, and memory is freed when no longer needed.

## 🎮 Bonus

For the bonus, I added a stationary enemy that acts like a wall. If the player touches the enemy, they lose the game. This adds difficulty by forcing the player to avoid the enemy while still collecting chests and reaching the exit.

## 💡 Inspiration

The So_Long project helped me dive deeper into game development and sharpen my C programming skills. It was inspired by the need to create a simple, interactive game in the terminal, while reinforcing concepts like memory management and data structure handling.
